Write code to produce the terminal output shown in each example block. You must use **logic** to output the answers.

1. Each username followed by its description. If there is no description (i.e.,
    `null` then print out "NA" instead):

    Example Output:

    ```no-highlight
    LaunchAcademy: A 10 week, intensive bootcamp teaching you how to code with a
    focus on Ruby on Rails
    dpickett: Co-Founder at @LaunchAcademy, Co-Organizer of @bostonrb
    STWatkins78: NA
    .
    .
    .
    ```

2. Each username followed by total number of followers.

    Example Output:

    ```no-highlight
    LaunchAcademy: 3590
    dpickett: 1604
    .
    .
    .
    ```

3. Each username and the length of their latest tweet.

    Example Output:

    ```no-highlight
    LaunchAcademy's latest tweet was 140 characters long.
    dpickett's latest tweet was 81 characters long.
    .
    .
    .
    ```

4. Each username followed by the total character count used in that user's last
    twenty tweets.

    Example Output:

    ```no-highlight
    LaunchAcademy used 2430 characters in their last twenty tweets.
    dpickett used 2147 characters in their last twenty tweets.
    .
    .
    .
    ```

5. Write Ruby code to answer each of the following questions about our Twitter
    data.

    As in the previous examples, display the answer to these questions in the
    terminal.

    * Which user has the most followers?

    Example Output:

    ```no-highlight
    LaunchAcademy has the most followers.
    ```

    * Which user has the most friends?

    Example Output:

    ```no-highlight
    dpickett has the most friends.
    ```
    * Which user has the greatest number of tweets?

    Example Output:

    ```no-highlight
    julissaJM has the greatest number of tweets.
    ```
    * Which users do not have a `description` listed in `twitter_data`?

    Example Output:

    ```no-highlight
    STWatkins78 does not have a description.
    Dot_the_speck does not have a description.
    wand_chris does not have a description.
    ```
    * Which users have a `location` listed in `twitter_data` and which ones do not? Organize these two groups into two separate lists based on whether they have a `location`.

    Example Output:

    ```no-highlight
    Has a location:
    LaunchAcademy
    dpickett
    chrisccerami
    spencercdixon
    corinnebabbles
    bostonrb
    judngu
    lizvdk
    hchood
    julissaJM
    ashleytbasinger
    alacritythief

    Does not have a location:
    STWatkins78
    Dot_the_speck
    wand_chris
    ```
